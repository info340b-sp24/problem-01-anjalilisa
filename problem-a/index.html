    <p> Katniss Everdeen is the main character in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hunger_Games"> The Hunger Games.</a>
        She is from District 12 which is a poor district. 
        Katniss ends up being selected for the Hunger Games, a competition where district children fight to the death. 
        This eventually sparks a rebellion that dismantles the entire structure of their government.
